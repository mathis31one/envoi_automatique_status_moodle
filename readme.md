## Installation :

On your Chrome application, create a new Profile and connect it to moodle.
Then go to chrome://version/ and copy executable path (looks like that : C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe) and Profile path (looks like that : C:\Users\MathisOneda\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Profile 1).

Now in the file settings.json, add the executable, set the User Profile as your path until User Date (here it would be C:\Users\MathisOneda\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data) and add the profile (here Profile 1) to the profile list

If you whant to add other profiles, you will just need to add the profile name in the profile list
